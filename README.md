# MIDI Support
MIDI Support is enabled via WebSocket connection through the Node.js server.

To begin sending MIDI messages to the client make sure you open a MIDI Connection between the MIDI Controller and your computer. (Audio MIDI Setup in Mac)

After the MIDI connection is opened, then you can start the Node.js server and run the app.

MIDI Messages are emitted to all connected clients.
